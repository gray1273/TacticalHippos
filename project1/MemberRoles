***Planning to do GUIs with Ruby-2d see https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/***

0. Initial Setup
	Get number of players (1-4) and player names, start game    **GUI will require text input**

1. Final GUI page
	Create PlayAgain Class - Constructor, isInBounds(position), yesClicked(position), noClicked(position)

2. Game Class
	Generate all cards in the deck and shuffle it -- set game.inProgress = true
	Create list of cards currently shown - call show on those cards
	Method to swap the selected 3 cards with the next 3 (remove old cards and show new cards)
	selectCard(Card) - Given this card if 3 cards are now selected call method above
	Method to confirm that a set of 3 cards is or is not a set
	Method that returns a set from those currently shown - Can just brute force

3. Game Class
	Add the initial mouse click method (should just call updateGame with the mouse's position)
	Create updateGame(position) - get the click's conext- Loop through UI elements calling .isInBounds(position) for each, call corresponding interfacing method if isInBounds
	Create interfacing methods between game and graphics - setCurrentPlayer, addHint, playAgain (selectCard also interfacing, implemented by 1.)

4. Way to swap between players 
	(i.e. create a box with player's name, when clicked, that player is selecting, change text color or something to emphasize)
	Hint Class - Constructor, isInBounds
	Player Class - name, points, updatePoints, addPoints, isSelected, Constructor(string name, int index), select, deselect, isInBounds(position)

5. Card class methods: isShown, isSelected, addHint, select, deselect, show(param table index), remove, isInBounds
	Card Class - Constructor(int, int, int, int) - Where each int cooresponds to a value - Opacity, Shape, Count, Color; Corresponding getter methods
